## âœŠ Why ExitSpotify?

> Daniel Ek invests more in weapons than he pays many artists. Thatâ€™s disgusting â€” but Spotify itself is even worse.  
> Music has become a service, a commodity. Everyone talks about culture, but no one really does much.  
> Boycotting Spotify is a concrete step toward giving music value again.  
> I hope this tool helps you migrate elsewhere.  
> Remember: if itâ€™s easy, itâ€™s not a protest â€” itâ€™s virtue signaling.
